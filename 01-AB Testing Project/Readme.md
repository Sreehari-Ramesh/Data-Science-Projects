# A/B Testing Project - Campaign Effectiveness Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on conducting A/B testing to analyze the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns. A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a statistical method that helps compare two versions (A and B) of a variable, typically in the context of marketing or product development, to determine which one performs better. In this case, the goal is to identify the most successful marketing campaign among the options tested.
